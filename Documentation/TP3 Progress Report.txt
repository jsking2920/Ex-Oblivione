TP3 Progress Report

-added necessary docs for tp3
-added a new console for drawing UI elements
-implemented a fuction for drawing bars for things like hp
-implemented a message log and integrated it into my game
-made sure that everything prints to message log instead of terminal
-added a start up message
-moved some things from main file into the initialize_new_game file


-implemented a fireball spell for attacking multiple enemies in a radius around the player
-implemented mp for the player to limit how much they can cast fireball
-implemented health and mp regeneration every turn
-rebalanced player and monster stats
-made hp and mp regen slower and made methods for regen
-made it so that health/mp regen only starts ticking once a player loses hp or mp which saves unneccasary work and prevents a player from healing right after taking damage for the first time
-made it so casting a spell resets mp_regen_tick meaning that a player must wait the delay after casting a spell to start regaining mp
-added a message that tells player how much mp they need to cast a spell if they try to cast a spell with too little mp
-made spell input/handeling more general to facilitate the addition of more spells
-added a cure spell that heals for a proportion of the players max_hp
-added a spell that can tunnel through walls with arrow keys
-fixed fov bugs with tunneling spell added check to make sure player doesn't go out of bounds
-added a spell called clairvoyance that reveals position of stairs
-made it so the radius a player can see is stored within the player entity, not in the constants dictionary to facilitate flash spell
-added a flash spell that increases the players fov radius for one turn
-implemented random movement for enemies outside of the players fov
-made it so that once an enemy has seen a player they will follow them even if they are outside of the player's fov
-changed tunneling spell so that it can clear multiple tiles in a line
-cleaned up comments on all files and checked citations/fixed minor style things/made restart r+shift to avoid misclicks
-slight balance tweaks/changed message at start of the game
-finished docs for tp3
