TP3 Update

Some changes were made to the design of the game since TP2. For one, the last algorithm for 
dungeon generation was cut due to a lack of time. Several of the extra features I considered working
on after MVP did not make it either for the same reason, but several spells were added to give
the player more interesting options.
